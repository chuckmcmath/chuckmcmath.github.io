# Chuck McMath

This repo is an assemblage (yeah, that's a [word](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/assemblage)) and presentation of various coding projects.

There's not much more to say than that.

My interests are in web-development, mostly front-end, though I'm also experienced in full-stack and server-side development. Lately all I seem to be doing is JavaScript though. Oh yeah, lately I've been workingg quite a bit with [D3](http://d3js.org), which is an awesome data visualization package.
